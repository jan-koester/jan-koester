# Software Architect & Archaeologist

I am a Senior Research Software Engineer and Architect bridging the gap between 
Classical Studies and advanced Data Engineering. 

As my work focuses on long-term institutional infrastructure, most of my 
contributions happen within organizations rather than on this personal profile.

## Involvements

### Current Responsibilities

- **Admin/DevOp** for the [TELOTA](https://github.com/telota) DH working group at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW). 
  *Focus: Infrastructure management, deployment, and system architecture.*

### Cross-Domain Expertise
My work is rooted in a deep dual background:
- **Humanities:** Trained Classical Archaeologist, Ancient Historian, and Philologist.
- **Engineering:** Specialist in SQL, PHP Laravel, Vue JS, Graph Databases (Neo4j), Knowledge Graphs, and Sustainable RSE.
